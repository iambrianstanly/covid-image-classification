# Covid Image Prediction 
The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for classifying COVID-19 infection from medical images, such as chest X-rays.By leveraging advanced neural network architectures, like Alexnet. The projectâ€™s goal is to enhance diagnostic capabilities, support healthcare providers, and contribute to more effective management and treatment of COVID-19 through innovative deep learning techniques.
